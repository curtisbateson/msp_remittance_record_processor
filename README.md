# MSP Remittance Record Processor

This script turns a text file into a CSV file. If the text file has MSP S00, S01, S02, or S03 remittance record lines, those lines will be parsed for easier reading.

## How to

1. Clone or fork this project
2. Rename your text file to `msp_raw.txt` and put it in the project folder
3. In your terminal, run `ruby script.rb`
4. Find the new CSV file named `msp_processed_(current date and time).csv` in the project folder
5. Celebrate the fact that you can actually read your file now :tada:
